# hello-world
Hello World! Just checking out github.

Changes made via the readme-edits branch here:
Astro-bot! Boy does our team need guys that can score.

I did not read about forks. This sounds like what I want, though.

Lets try making changes using the github desktop app. Need to make the edits outside of the app.

Adding another line just to see the history graph move.
After the commit there are three circles. Two solid and one dashed.
